## ✨ Practicum Progress Update – Application Development @ North Seattle College

Over the past four weeks (Weeks 7–10), I’ve made significant progress on two full-stack practicum projects: **Belinda’s Closet** and **NSC Events**. Both are real-world applications serving our college community, and I’m excited to share what I’ve been working on as part of the Application Development BAS program.

### 👩‍💻 Project 1: Belinda’s Closet

**Goal:** A donation management system that helps students access free clothing from the North Seattle College community.
**Problem Solved:** Streamlines inventory management, donation processing, and student access to available items.

**🔧 My Role & Contributions:**

* ✅ **Implemented unit tests** for critical components like the Forgot Password page using **React Testing Library** and **Jest**, ensuring the form handles input, submission, loading, and error states reliably.
* ✅ Reviewed pull requests and assisted in test file organization and refactoring.
* ✅ Contributed to documenting GitHub issues clearly, following professional standards for issue tracking and resolution.
* ✅ Collaborated with teammates in dev meetings to align on functionality, testing strategy, and component design.

**🔍 Challenge:** Mocking hooks like `useMediaQuery` and `useTheme` in MUI during testing was tricky.
**💡 Solution:** Learned to mock MUI hooks and asynchronous fetch calls effectively in Jest to isolate component behavior.

### 🎉 Project 2: NSC Events Site

**Goal:** A centralized platform to list and manage college events, allowing students and staff to create, view, and archive events.
**Problem Solved:** Improves visibility and accessibility of campus activities.

**🔧 My Role & Contributions:**

* ✅ Built and tested the **Creator Dashboard Page**, including logic for role-based access control (`creator` role), MUI layout, and responsive UI.
* ✅ Designed and tested navigation buttons for routes like `Create Event`, `My Events`, `Archived Events`, etc.
* ✅ Mocked authentication (`useAuth`) to run isolated tests in a controlled environment.

**🔍 Challenge:** Ensuring that only authenticated users with the correct role could access certain pages.
**💡 Solution:** Created a reusable `useAuth()` hook with proper conditional rendering and fallback UI (`UnauthorizedPageMessage`).

* 📌 Improved my ability to debug and validate role-based routing logic
* 📌 Practiced clean component design and team collaboration in a real-world project setting
* 📌 Learned to write professional GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Scrum documentation

I’m proud of the work I’ve done and grateful for the learning opportunities from this practicum. Excited to continue pushing these projects forward!

If you’re working on something similar or curious about how we test and build React + Next.js apps in a team environment, feel free to reach out or share your thoughts.
